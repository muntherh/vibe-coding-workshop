/**
 * Deck-wide locale and writing direction.
 *
 * Direction is fixed for a given deck rather than toggled at runtime: a
 * workshop is presented in one language, and a constant lets the bundler
 * strip the branch that is never taken. Set both values once, here.
 *
 * Everything that can be expressed as CSS is already direction-agnostic —
 * the shell uses logical utilities (ms/me, ps/pe, start/end, text-start)
 * that flip on their own when `dir="rtl"` is on <html>. Only two things
 * genuinely need to know the direction in JavaScript, and both read IS_RTL:
 *
 *   1. The prev/next chevrons, which point at a physical direction.
 *   2. The arrow keys, where "forward" is ArrowRight in LTR and
 *      ArrowLeft in RTL.

 * front of a room. `scaffold.sh` fills this in from the title you pass it.
